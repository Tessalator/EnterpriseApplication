Enterprise Application
=====================

Simple Applications for Common Business Needs 


Enterprise is a project designed to help eliminate rebuilding the same application over and over.
Enterprise consists of two parts, a reference model with specifications for common Things of the Enterprise (Github - Tessalator/Enterprise) and this set of applications that leverages the model to create simple applications for common needs such as Project Management, Service Desk/Delivery, and Process Management (Standard Operating Procedures).
